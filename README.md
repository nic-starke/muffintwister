# MuffinTwister
*An open source alternative firmware for the excellent Midi Fighter Twister from DJ Tech Tools*


## About
This project was started to add new functionality to the Midi Fighter Twister. 
It is based on [AVR-GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc) and the excellent [LUFA USB libraries](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php)


## Planned Features
The overall intention for the project is to remove some of the limitations of the original firmware, such as fixed midi channels, however there is the possibility of adding new features.
See below regarding feature requests.

## Feature Requests and Bug Reports
Please use the [issues](https://github.com/bxzn/MuffinTwister/issues) page of the repository to request new features, or to submit a bug.

## Why Muffin Twister?
- To add new features to the MFT, and fix some of the original firmwares' curiosities.
- To provide a clean and well organised firmware project that other users can extend for themselves.
- As a personal project to experiment with the AVR platform.
